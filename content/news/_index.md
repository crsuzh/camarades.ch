Visit our CAMARADES/STRIDE summer school and learn how to conduct your own systematic review!

**Save the date: August 28th – 31st 2023, University of Zurich​**
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

**Focus, goals, and target groups​**

The growth of biomedical literature presents challenges for reproducible research. To address this, researchers need tools to manage data and conduct structured research. The summer school aims to equip participants with skills to conduct systematic reviews of animal studies independently and introduce them to concepts of automation in the systematic review process. Additionally, the school seeks to expand collaborations and promote ongoing preclinical research. The school is primarily aimed at PhD students and postdoctoral researchers at the University of Zurich who conduct research on animals. However, the school welcomes participants from other departments and institutes who want to learn about systematic reviews in preclinical research.​

​
**Overall program and organizers​**

The summer school is focused on hands-on sessions: participants will work on their own systematic review project with the support of attending tutors. The course requires participants actively engage and participate in these sessions. The summer school will be chaired by Dr. Benjamin Ineichen, head of STRIDE-Lab and CAMARADES Zurich. Alongside other course organizers, he will give lectures and workshops on the subject, while tutors Dr. Marianna Rosso and Simona Doneva will provide expertise on systematic review methodology. Dr. Rachel Heyard will focus on reproducible science, and Professor Malcolm Macleod and Dr. Cathalijn Leenaars are planned external speakers. ​

**Requirements​**

To apply for our summer school, each participant is required to formulate their own research question which will form the basis to conduct a systematic review. During the course, we will support each participant in advancing their own systematic review ​

**The 5th International SR-SAVI Conference is taking place in Zürich!**

**Save the date: October 17th – 18th 2024, University of Zurich​**

A 2-day international meeting on Systematic Reviews of Animal studies and in VItro.\
Our priority topics for discussion include: 
- The integration of automation and AI in systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
- Translational research bridging animal studies to human applications and policy implementation.
- Identification and management of questionable research practices and potential research misconduct.

The conference will feature a reproducibility challenge, which includes an effort to reproduce various steps of published systematic reviews and offers a prize (see below).

**Abstract submission details**\
We encourage you to submit an abstract for a presentation or poster session focused on these areas. Additionally, we welcome abstracts on other relevant topics within the scope of systematic reviews and meta-analysis.

Abstracts should be submitted by July 15th, 2024, via the registration form below. The title should not exceed 25 words, and the body text is limited to 300 words. All the abstracts exceeding the word limit will not be considered. Abstracts should be structured in introduction, objective, methods, results, and conclusion (ignore the results/concluson section if you submit preliminary work/study protocols). We encourage all participants to submit abstracts on going projects, preprints, or research projects, as the conference provides a great opportunity to receive feedback from experts on further analysis and steps.

**CAMARADES Reproducibility Challenge**\
The CAMARADES Reproducibility Challenge aims to assess the status quo of replicability and reproducibility of Systematic Reviews of animal and in vitro studies. We cordially invite you to participate individually or as a team! As participant(s), you will (try to) replicate part of a published Systematic Review of animal or in vitro studies and assess:

1) The replicability of the original SR, e.g. which hurdles did you encounter when trying to replicate the methodology used?
2) The reproducibility of the findings, i.e. to what extent were the results of the original SR reproduced?

The Challenge will run up to September 30th 2024. All participants who submit a reproducibility report will be invited to co-author a publication in which all Reproducibility Challenge outputs will be summarized, and recommendations for the field will be formulated. All participants are also invited to present the results of their reproducibility attempt at the International Systematic Reviews of Studies in Animals and in VItro (SR-SAVI) conference, Oct 17-18, in Zurich, Switzerland. A prize for the best Report will be awarded!

We hope you will join the challenge!  Sign up for the Reproducibility Challenge using this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScS5K3sFxZRlO8bWmeqn1IqTDtDV-ZRH39CtZJVdzCOwRjTSg/viewform).

**Visit our CAMARADES/STRIDE summer school and learn how to conduct your own animal systematic review!**

**Save the date: August 28th – 31st 2023, University of Zurich​**

The CAMARADES Zurich/STRIDE-lab is inviting you to join us for the **Summer School on the Systematic Review of Animal Research** from August 28th to 31st 2023 in Zurich! Discover how systematic reviews can help you navigate the expanding field of biomedical literature and conduct reproducible and evidence-based research.

During this summer school, you will learn how systematic reviews can be used to map a research field, to assess animal-to-human translation, and apply the principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement) to optimize animal experimentation. You will receive comprehensive guidance on conducting reproducible and rigorous systematic reviews of animal studies being equiped to conduct your own systematic reviews.

The course is free. Seats are limited. Register here.

2 ECTS is recommended for completion of the course. We are currently ensuring that the course counts as continuing education for animal experimenters.

We look forward to welcoming you to the Summer School on the Systematic Review of Animal Research!

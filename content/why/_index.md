Systematic reviews follow a rigorous methodology. With this, they have **several strengths**:
* Systematic reviews can help to deal with the evidence overload by summarizing large numbers of studies.
* Systematic reviews can identify inconsistencies in the literatures and resolve uncertainties.
* Systematic reviews can mitigate certain biases when answering specific questions.
* Because systematic reviews employ transparent and reproducible methodology, they can readily be updated as new data becomes available.
* Systematic reviews can inform future research directions and also improve future research.
* Meta-analyses can help smaller studies to reach statistical significance and also to triangulate heterogeneity within a certain field.
Based on these strengths, systematic reviews are at the top of the so-called evidence pyramid, meaning they form the highest level of evidence.

In addition, systematic reviews of animal studies are a **valuable tool to inform the 3R principles (replacement, reduction, refinement)** which are a framework for humane animal research:
* By systematically reviewing the literature, unnecessary duplication of animal experiments can be reduced.
* Systematic reviews can be catalysts to improve design, quality, and reporting of animal studies.
* Producing additional scientific insights without using additional animals.
* Fostering animal-to-human translation by making the evidence obtained from animal studies more transparent and accessible, thus reducing research waste.

With this, systematic reviews and meta-analyses are a great tool to **probe a field** (e.g., when starting a PhD), to **assess failures or successes in bench-to-bedside translation**, to **inform early phase clinical trials or future preclinical studies**, and to **foster 3R principles**.
